## Browser Support

flexCarousel.js supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers except Internet Explorer.

We build the carousels using Flexbox browser technology and ES6 syntax which is compiled to ES5 for production-ready code. You can find browser compatibility statistics for both Flexbox and ES5 on [Can I use...](https://caniuse.com).

However, for a quick overview - read the table below which shows you the browser support for flexCarousel.js. All browser tests are conducted with [Browser Stack](https://browserstack.com).

| Microsoft Edge | Mozilla Firefox | Google Chrome | Safari | Opera |

| >=16 | >=52 | >=55 | >=11.1 | >=42 |

### Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer 6-11 is not supported as some modern CSS properties and HTML elements do not function correctly. Your application's users will most likely not be using Internet Explorer anyway but a more modern browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox which versions are widely supported by flexCarousel.js.
